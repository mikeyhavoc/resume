# Resume

It took me a while to get on this. 
but I felt it was time now. 
To put my resume into a responsive web page while I prepare to job hunt.

As, I start to hunt for a job I will start to build this, a Portfolio page, and projects to fill the portfolio page.

## Why now

After 4 years of college and a year off I felt I have gained enough experience of learning to be worthy of being accepted into a company...finally.

and I am here to show it.
